# ROM Sorter

## Description

Ever had a ROM collection littered with different versions, hacks, homebrew content or ROMs from different countries?
I have, it's frustrating to have to scrub through them and remove those extra ROMS.
This is why I made this utility to remove the hardwork for you so you can enjoy your collections the way you want to.

## Installation

Download the latest release.
Extract to any location on your local system.
Open rom_sorter.py in your favourite editor.
At "folder_path =", define the path to your folder of ROMs.
If there are extra keywords that you want to use, just add them under "keywords =".

## Usage

Open up a terminal, and ensure you go to where the utility has been saved.
Windows users can run the script by just calling - rom_sorter.py
The utility will print all operations and let you know how many files have been scrubbed.

## Contributing

Feel free to fork this repo and modify as you see fit.
I only ask for a mention.
